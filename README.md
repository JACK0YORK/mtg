# MTG

This is a directory containing a variety of personal projects I have built out for Magic the Gathering, a card game.

`mycube.py` - This is a CLI tool that allows you to search and add cards from a database to a "cube", or a localized collection of cards to play with. It features fuzzy-finding and some syntax highlighting.
`setsymbols/generate_symbols.py` - This is a tool to take icons and convert them into valid icons that represent the rarity of a card from a custom set. It involves some image processing with pillow.
`customcards/render.py` - This is a tool to render custom cards. It does not yet have an easy-to-use interface, but can fit text and symbols to a template. This also involved some webscraping (`manascraper.py`)
